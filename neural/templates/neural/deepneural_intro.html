      <h2>Why We Chose AI for Healthcare</h2>
      <p>
        Healthcare and medicine are one of the most vital aspects of human civilization. Throughout the centuries - and most recently - medicine has
        allowed humanity to achieve wonders the likes of which were unheard of in ages of old; we were able to discover cures for the most life-threathening
        of diseases such as - but not limited to - Cholera, Malaria, and more recently, Covid-19. The aforementioned examples mark a minor percentage
        of the total amount of illnesses humanity has successfully been able to overcome. However, the fight for a healthier species is still far out of reach.
        Recent advancements in artificial intelligence, and more specifically, machine learning, have - and 
        will continue to - catalyze medical breakthroughs. Our mission therefore, is to be a part of that future; a world where we as a species can thrive,
        knowing that we have successfully found the cure to most, if not all, viral, bacterial, and cancerous illnesses. 
      </p>
      <p>
        At it's core, DeepNeural is, in its current state, a start-up project seeking to develop a plethora of machine learning models - ranging
        from classical ML models (tabular), to natural language and computer vision - with the goal of aiding medical professionals and their respective patients,
        ensuring faster diagnostics of various illnesses, to promote a greater well-being for those who are truly in need, in a quick period of time; nothing is more
        important than the health of a patient, and DeepNeural seeks to work with that statement in mind.  
      </p>
      <p>
        This however, is not where this project for better healthcare meets a halt; the healthcare sector provides a great amount of flexibility for
        expansion; medical robotics, assistive chatbots for mental well-being, and neural interfaces capable of providing those individuals who are paraplegic,
        the ability to live their lives to the fullest once more; this is DeepNeural's overall vision, and although the project is still in its infancy,
        that vision, will be attained. Humanity's health, happiness, and prosperity is our top priority.
